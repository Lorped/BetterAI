**This mod is work in progress. You are free to use any content from it aslong as you reference this project.

<h2>What is this mod?</h2>
This mod is an enhancement of existing  AI tweaking mods. Thanks to all already existing AI mods for inspiration.

**PLAY THIS GAME ON HARD.**
<h1> So... what's the actual content?</h1>
<h3>Difficulty</h3>
 I tweaked the bonuses for the difficulty. Currently only Hard is modded. "Hard" provides -1 unrest for AI and 10%/25%/50% forcelimit for AI for age of reformation/absolutism/revolution
This mod is supposed to enhance the behavior of the AI to actually invest in Missionaries, to build more buildings and to wage more wars with the goal of blobbing like a player would. 
<h3>Buildings</h3>
Still, a nation is nothing without proper building structure. Therefore the building importance got tweaked a bit to prefer manufactories, workshops, etc. and to give less importance to docks and similar. 
<h3>Fort upgrades</h3>
With this mod, the AI is capable of upgrading their forts more consistently when higher military techs are reached. No more level 2 forts in 1700 russia. Of course the AI pays for it aswell, just like the player does.
<h3>AI mana spending!</h3>
This current revision also contains improvements to AI mana spending, meaning it will not waste mana when reaching cap but instead try to invest into provinces. This functionality should be in the basegame!.
<h3>Devpushing Institutions</h3>
The AI now is also capable of devpushing institutions in the best provinces it can find, meaning either capital, gold provinces or just provinces with good trade goods. Of course the AI can't do it for free, meaning it spends 2k mana like the player does.

**This mod will not do miracles. It will just try to use the tools we have on our disposale.**
<h1>Just now, I'm working on...</h1>
- AI_army script bugfix (!!! POSTPONED SINCE WAITING ON RESPONSE FROM PARADOX)

- updating mod to properly function in 1.30.X + create heuristics for new meta gameplay

<h2>CURRENTLY ON TODO-LIST (recommendations welcome)</h2>

* War logic

  * properly assigning edicts at war
  * AI is not ruthless enough is hunting down enemy armies and does not lock down a region as desired
  * AI should avoid attrition (ever seen a 1.3m forcelimit ottomans navigating? With this mod you will)
  * make england/GB and naval invasions overall useful again

* Infrastructure logic
  * missionaries still not assigned when budget is low
  * make AI use their missionaries!
* Overall
  * AI alliance evaluation is not satisfying enough
  * use estates for power (could be an ai-event every 20 years for ~100 monarch points each)
  * properly calculate dev cost. Currently it's just an estimate based on the amount of base_tax/production/manpower the province has, meaning base-to-dev * 10 is the cost.
  * push natives to complete their religion minigame before they get slaughtered

<h1>ISSUES</h1>
- None currently
